#PROJECT TITLE
BMI CALCULATOR


#PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator estimates body fat based on weight and height using the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / height² (m²). It helps classify individuals as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese. Though simple and widely used, it doesn’t account for muscle mass or fat distribution.
