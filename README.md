#PROJECT TITLE
BMI CALCULATOR


#PROJECT DESCRIPTION
🧮 BMI Calculator – Web Application A BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is a simple yet powerful health-related tool. It helps users determine whether their weight is healthy in proportion to their height. This web-based application allows users to input their weight and height, calculate their BMI instantly, and understand which BMI category they fall into.

✨ Key Features (Features ko aur expand kiya gaya hai) Clean & Minimal UI Designed with simplicity in mind — no clutter, easy-to-use interface, suitable for all age groups.

Input Fields for Height and Weight Users can enter their height and weight in either metric or imperial units (optional extension).

Real-time or Button-triggered Calculation Depending on implementation:

Real-time: BMI updates instantly as the user types.

Button-triggered: BMI is calculated after the user clicks "Calculate".

Display of Results The calculated BMI value is shown along with a message like:

🟦 Underweight (BMI < 18.5)

🟩 Normal weight (BMI 18.5–24.9)

🟧 Overweight (BMI 25–29.9)

🟥 Obese (BMI ≥ 30)

Responsive Design Works on desktops, tablets, and phones seamlessly.

💻 Tech Stack (Aur zyada detail mein) Frontend HTML5: Used for building the structure of the webpage — input fields, labels, buttons, etc.

CSS3: Used to style the page — fonts, colors, layout, responsiveness.

Logic Layer ⚠️ You mentioned Java, but for browser-based apps, usually JavaScript is used. If it’s a mistake:

JavaScript: Used to handle events (e.g., button click), retrieve input values, calculate BMI, and update the result dynamically.

OR

If you are really using Java for backend logic:

You might be using a Java Servlet, JSP, or Spring Boot to process user input on the server and return the BMI result.

This would require a client-server model with requests and responses.
