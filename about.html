                What is BMI?
                Body Mass Index is a common screening tool used to estimate body fat based on height and weight. It helps categorize weight status (like underweight, healthy weight, overweight) and can be a useful indicator for potential health considerations.
                
                Our Tool
                Our calculator is designed for simplicity. Just enter your details, and get your BMI result instantly. It's a convenient way to monitor changes or simply understand where you stand according to this widely recognized index.
                
                Important Note
                While BMI is a valuable starting point, it's not a definitive diagnostic tool. It doesn't differentiate between fat and muscle, and factors like age, sex, and ethnicity can influence its interpretation. The results provided here are for informational purposes only. We strongly encourage you to discuss your BMI and overall health with a healthcare provider for personalized advice and a complete picture.
